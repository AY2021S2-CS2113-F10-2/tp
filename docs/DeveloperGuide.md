## Design

This section describes design details of the app Healthier.

### Architecture

![architecture](./diagrams/DG_Images/architecture.png)
<h5 align="center">Figure 1: Architecture Diagram</h5>
The high-level design of Healthier is shown in *Figure 1: Architecture Diagram* given above.

`Healthier` corresponds to the main class that coordinates the execution of this application. It is where the `main`
method is located. It is responsible for,

* When app starts: Initializes essential data objects from stored files and displays basic information about the status
  of the app by utilizing the UI component.
* When app is running: Handles user input and coordinates corresponding operations by invoking methods from `Parser`
  and `Command` classes.
* When app ends: Terminates the execution of this app.

`Common` contains classes that can be repeatedly used by other components.

In addition to that, the app also consists of following components:

* `UI`: Handles the display of ui messages as well as user input.
* `Parser`: Processes the raw user input with validations and passes usable info to `Command` components.
* `Command`: Performs operations according to the command that the user input.
* `Storage`: Handles the read & write of various data files created/stored locally.
* `Account`: Manages the user accounts.
* `Entity`: Contains data objects that are essential to thi app.

> ðŸ’¡Healthier is an application that runs locally without Internet connections.  
> Data files will be stored in the format of plain-text documents for easy inspection and test.

Each of the components has corresponding Java classes that

* Define data attributes and methods in different levels of abstraction.
* Provide various APIs (i.e. public members) that can be utilized by other classes.

More information about the components will be discussed in the [Components](#components) section.

#### The interaction between major components

We will take how Healthier handles user's input as an representative example to illustrate the internal logic of this
application.

The *Sequence Diagram* of the operation is given below:
![Sequence diagram of handling user input](./diagrams/DG_Images/handleUserInput.png)
<h5 align="center">Figure 2: Sequence Diagram of handling user input</h5>

After initialization, `Healthier` calls the `loopCommand()` method, which gets user input in a while loop which
terminates only when the command is `exit`, i.e. `"exit"` is received.  
Inside the loop, `UI` will handle the read of user input, and pass the raw input in `String` to `CommandParser`, where
the input will be validated and a corresponding instance of `Command` will be created.  
After that, the `execute` command will be invoked and the returned result in `String` will be printed by `UI`. At the
end of the loop, the `store()` method of `Storage` will be called to update the local files to reflect any changes, and
the parsed parameters in `CommandParser` will be cleared to get ready for next parse.

### Components

#### Entity classes component

![Structure of the Entity Classes](./diagrams/DG_Images/entityClasses.png)
<h5 align="center">Figure 3: class structure for entity classes</h5>

* Each`User` stores a `FitCenter` object that holds all the records and goals for the user.
* Each `FitCenter` stores four `RecordList` and four `GoalList` for `EXERCISE`, `DIET`, `SLEEP`, `BODY_WEIGHT` type respectively.
* `Record` is an abstract class, which is the superclass for different types of records.
* `Goal` is an abstract class, which is the superclass for different types of goals. 
* Each `RecordList` is composed of `Record`. Each `GoalList` is composed of `Goal`.

## Implementation

This section describes some details on how certain features of Healthier are implemented.

### [Proposed] Add record feature

#### Proposed implementation

Adding a record to record list is achieved by `AddCommand` and `RecordList`. Records of the same category are stored as
a `RecordList`. A `ReocrdList` supports the following operation:

* `RecordList#addRecord(Record newRecord)` â€” Add a new record of the specified type to the list.

All `Record` in a `RecordList` are of the same type so each user has 4 `RecordList` to hold `EXERCISE`, `DIET`
, `BODY_WEIGHT`, `SLEEP` records respectively.

`FitCenter` is a uniform interface to manipulate all the `RecordList` and provide
interface `FitCenter#addRecordToList(CommandRecordType type, Record record)`

Given below is an example of interaction among classes to add a new exercise record:

Step 1. The user enters a valid `add` command. An `AddCommand` will be initialized with the parsed parameters from user
input.

Step 2. The `AddCommand` initializes a `Record` and
calls `FitCenter#FitCenter#addRecordToList(CommandRecordType type, Record record)` to add the record.

> ðŸ’¡  If any of the parameters passed are invalid, `AddCommand` will throw an error and will not call `FitCenter#FitCenter#addRecordToList(CommandRecordType type, Record record)`, so the record will not be saved into the `RecordList`.


Step 3.`FitCenter#FitCenter#addRecordToList(CommandRecordType type, Record record)`
calls `RecordList#addRecord(Record newRecord)` to modify the list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add` command works:
