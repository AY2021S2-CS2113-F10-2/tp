## Design

This section describes design details of the app Healthier.

### Architecture

![architecture](./diagrams/DG_Images/architecture.png)
<h5 align="center">Figure 1: Architecture Diagram</h5>
The high-level design of Healthier is shown in *Figure 1: Architecture Diagram* given above.

`Healthier` corresponds to the main class that coordinates the execution of this application. It is where the `main`
method is located. It is responsible for,

* When app starts: Initializes essential data objects from stored files and displays basic information about the status
  of the app by utilizing the UI component.
* When app is running: Handles user input and coordinates corresponding operations by invoking methods from `Parser`
  and `Command` classes.
* When app ends: Terminates the execution of this app.

`Common` contains classes that can be repeatedly used by other components.

In addition to that, the app also consists of following components:

* `UI`: Handles the display of ui messages as well as user input.
* `Parser`: Processes the raw user input with validations and passes usable info to `Command` components.
* `Command`: Performs operations according to the command that the user input.
* `Storage`: Handles the read & write of various data files created/stored locally.
* `Account`: Manages the user accounts.
* `Entity`: Contains data objects that are essential to this app.

> ðŸ’¡Healthier is an application that runs locally without Internet connections.  
> Data files will be stored in the format of plain-text documents for easy inspection and test.

Each of the components has corresponding Java classes that

* Define data attributes and methods in different levels of abstraction.
* Provide various APIs (i.e. public members) that can be utilized by other classes.

More information about the components will be discussed in the [Components](#components) section.

#### The interactions between major components

We will take how Healthier handles user's input as an representative example to illustrate the internal logic of this
application.

The *Sequence Diagram* of the operation is given below:
![Sequence diagram of handling user input](./diagrams/DG_Images/handleUserInput.png)
<h5 align="center">Figure 2: Sequence Diagram of handling user input</h5>

After initialization, `Healthier` calls the `loopCommand()` method, which gets user input in a while loop which
terminates only when the command is `exit`, i.e. `"exit"` is received.  
Inside the loop, `UI` will handle the read of user input, and pass the raw input in `String` to `CommandParser`, where
the input will be validated and a corresponding instance of `Command` will be created.  
After that, the `execute` command will be invoked and the returned result in `String` will be printed by `UI`. At the
end of the loop, the `store()` method of `Storage` will be called to update the local files to reflect any changes, and
the parsed parameters in `CommandParser` will be cleared to get ready for next parse.

### Components

#### UI component

**API**: `UI.java`

* Provides various public methods defined for displaying messages in the CLI, such as command result & error messages.
* Facilitates getting raw user input in `String`.
* Instances are primarily utilized in `Healthier.java`, where the `main` method is located.

#### Parser component

**API**: `CommandParser.java`

* Gets raw user input in `String` passed by the `UI` component.
* Recognizes command patterns from the raw input according to the command syntax.
* Validates mandatory/optional arguments supplied by the user.
* Processes and packages the arguments in the format that can be used by `Command` components.
* Returns a new `Command` instance initialized with relevant parameters according to the user input.
* Returns `InvalidCommand` if an erroneous input is received.

#### Command component

**APIs**: `Command.java`, `CommandResult.java`, etc

* Consists of an abstract class `Command.java` from which all other command classes (subclasses) inherit.
* Each subclass corresponds to one text command defined in the user guide.
* Each subclass must implement the abstract `execute` method, which invokes APIs defined in `Entity` classes to perform
  an operation.
* Each subclass has an attribute `feedback`, which is a `String` that stores the result of the command execution.

How the command is executed?

1. `UI` component takes in user's input, which is then passed to `Parser` component.
2. `Parser` component processes the user input and create a `Command` object initialized with relevant parameters.
3. The `Command` object is returned to `Healthier`, in which the `execute` method is invoked.
4. The `execute` method returns the execution result in `String`, which is displayed by `UI`.

#### Entity component

**APIs**: `Goal.java`,`Record.java`,`GoalList.java`, `RecordList.java`, etc

![Structure of the Entity Classes](./diagrams/DG_Images/entityClasses.png)
<h5 align="center">Figure 3: class structure for entity classes</h5>

* Each`User` stores a `FitCenter` object that holds all the records and goals for the user.
* Each `FitCenter` stores four `RecordList` and four `GoalList` for `EXERCISE`, `DIET`, `SLEEP`, `BODY_WEIGHT` type
  respectively.
* `Record` is an abstract class, which is the superclass for different types of records.
* `Goal` is an abstract class, which is the superclass for different types of goals.
* Each `RecordList` is composed of `Record`. Each `GoalList` is composed of `Goal`.

#### Common component

**API**: `messages.java`

* Classes that can be repeatedly used by other components are located in the `seedu.duke.common` package.
* Currently used as collection of frequently used messages.

## Implementation

This section describes details of how some of the important features are implemented, which can give some insights about
how features are realized in general.

### Add record feature

Adding a record to record list is achieved by `AddCommand` and `RecordList`. Records of the same category are stored as
a `RecordList`. A `ReocrdList` supports the following operation:

* `RecordList#addRecord(Record newRecord)` â€” Add a new record of the specified type to the list.

All `Record` in a `RecordList` are of the same type so each user has 4 `RecordList` to hold `EXERCISE`, `DIET`
, `BODY_WEIGHT`, `SLEEP` records respectively.

`FitCenter` is a uniform interface to manipulate all the `RecordList` and provide
interface `FitCenter#addRecordToList(CommandRecordType type, Record record)`

Given below is an example of interaction among classes to add a new exercise record:

Step 1. The user enters a valid `add` command. An `AddCommand` will be initialized with the parsed parameters from user
input.

Step 2. The `AddCommand` initializes a `Record` and
calls `FitCenter#FitCenter#addRecordToList(CommandRecordType type, Record record)` to add the record.

> ðŸ’¡ If any of the parameters passed are invalid, `AddCommand` will throw an error and will not call `FitCenter#FitCenter#addRecordToList(CommandRecordType type, Record record)`, so the record will not be saved into the `RecordList`.


Step 3.`FitCenter#FitCenter#addRecordToList(CommandRecordType type, Record record)`
calls `RecordList#addRecord(Record newRecord)` to modify the list.

The following sequence diagram shows how the `add` command works:

![Sequence diagram of adding a new record](./diagrams/DG_Images/addRecordSequence.png)
<h5 align="center">Figure 3: Sequence Diagram of adding a record</h5>

[**Get back to Table of Contents**](#table-of-contents)

### Set Goal feature

The functionality of setting a goal and maintaining the goal in a goal list is achieved by `SetCommand`.   
The realization is facilitated by `FitCenter`, as discussed previously in the [Add record feature](#add-record-feature)
.  
A goal has the following attributes: `dateSet`, `intervalType`, `target`, and `progress`.   
As a goal corresponds to a kind of record, each goal object will also have a `type` attribute, which can be `EXERCISE`
, `DIET`, `SLEEP`, and `BODYWEIGHT`.  
Hence, once a goal object is created, it will be added to a `GoalList` in which more operations are defined and utilized
by `FitCenter`, which contains the following method:

* `FitCenter#addGoalToList(CommandRecordType type, Goal goal)` - add a goal object to the goal list.

**How the setting is done?**

Take the example of setting a goal:

Step 1. The user enters a valid set command. A `SetCommand` instance will be initialized with parameters from user input
parsed by `CommandParser` .

Step 2. The `SetCommand` initializes a `Goal` with parameters specified by the user, and the command object is returned
to `Healthier`.

Step 3. The `execute` method of the `SetCommand` object is invoked, and it
calls `FitCenter#addGoalToList(CommandRecordType type, Goal goal)` by passing the goal object of a particular record
type, which adds the goal into the goal list.

Step 4. If the `Goal` object is not null, `FitCenter#addGoalToList(CommandRecordType type, Goal goal)`
calls `GoalList#addGoal(Goal newGoal)` to update the list and the progress of the goal (if any).

The following *Sequence Diagram* illustrates how the `set` command works:
